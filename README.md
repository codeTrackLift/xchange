## How to Run

> Account Management & User Data

Users can create a new account or log into an existing account on the Account page.  User data is stored in local storage and session storage, cookies can be reset on the User Data Page.

> Deposits and Withdrawals

Once logged in, users can make transactions on the respective pages.  The app will validate the user's input and notify the user of any errors.

> Currency Calculator & Exchange Rates

API data is fetched from CoinGecko.com upon page load. The app will display the current exchange rates for today's date.  The user can use the currency calculator to convert between currencies.
